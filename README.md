swarm-2.0
=========

Edited version of 'Swarmwise' by Rick Falkvinge.

Today I completed editing on Swarm 2.0. 

Whew.

The object of this project, started in 2014 and ongoing, is to produce training material on initiating, growing and assisting swarms. What’s a swarm?

“A swarm is a decentralized, collaborative effort of volunteers that looks like a traditional hierarchical organization from the outside. It is built by a small core of people that construct a scaffolding of go-to people, enabling numbers of volunteers to cooperate on a common goal on a scale not possible before the net.” - Rick Falkvinge

Sounds good to me. 

The next step is to produce an interactive visual novel (using the Ren’Py game development package - for now) that will let someone with a swarmworthy idea educate themselves on the steps to create and grow a swarm. At this point the Swarmsteps game is the fragments abstracted from “Swarmwise”  - so if you’re a game dev, an artist, a musician or someone who wants to learn, let me know. 

Swarm on!

Before you swarm.


Are enough people affected by this idea, and can a large enough number of people be energized to contribute to it in order to pass the critical threshold? Can the threshold be identified, and, if so, how many people must get onboard for your idea to succeed?


We must determine what the success criterion for the idea is. What event constitutes success, and what does it take to get there?


 identify the group of people affected in a positive direction by your provocative idea, estimate the size of that group, and then make an educated guesstimate as to what portion of this group may engage in the swarm at the lowest level of activation.


if you start talking about abstract concepts, you’ll just have yawns among your prospective volunteers. We’ll need a large recruitment surface with concepts that are easy to relate to people’s everyday lives in order to grow the swarm to critical mass.


How do you gather a swarm around the idea?


a swarm will form as long as you present a compelling enough idea that people feel that they can be part of.


Your idea needs to be tangible, credible, inclusive, and epic.


Tangible: You need to post an outline of the goals you intend to meet, when, and how.


Credible: After having presented your daring goal, you need to present it as totally doable. Bonus points if nobody has done it before.


Inclusive: There must be room for participation by every spectator who finds it interesting, and they need to realize this on hearing about the project.


Epic: Finally, you must set out to change the entire world for the better — or at least make a major improvement for a lot of people.












the first six to eight days of the swarm




The swarm’s very first task will be to self-organize, and it excels at such tasks. But it is you who must set the structure and explicitly give the swarm the task to self-organize.


You will be able to coordinate at most thirty groups, so create a discussion forum with at most that number of subgroups. 
pick your geographical division so that the typical size is about seven members and no subgroup has more than thirty members.  create the subgroups in a way that will cause this division to happen.


tell everybody to go to the appropriate subgroup and meet with other people who go there. Tell people to introduce themselves to one another, and to select a leader


set up a subforum where these subgroup leaders can discuss things between themselves and with you


As the swarm organizes into these subgroups by geography, it needs to be given a task immediately that allows it to jell properly over the first four weeks or so of its existence. Update the overall progress of the goal at least daily.getting people to know other people should be an overarching goal of your activities. make sure that newcomers feel welcome


For every new relationship that is created, the organization grows.


The organization consists only of relationships between people.
